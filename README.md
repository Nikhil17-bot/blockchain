# Project Title: Blockchain-based Certificate Revocation Registry

## ðŸ“˜ Project Description

This project enables educational institutions or certifying authorities to not only issue digital certificates on the blockchain but also **revoke** them when necessary. The revocation process is entirely transparent, immutable, and can be verified by third parties, employers, or universities.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Vision

To create a **trustless verification** ecosystem for academic and professional certificates that allows institutions to maintain integrity by providing a way to **revoke credentials** on-chain when needed.

## ðŸ”‘ Key Features

- Issue certificates using student details, course, and issue date.
- Revoke certificates that are invalid or mistakenly issued.
- Fetch certificate details using their hash.
- Update course details for an existing certificate.
- On-chain visibility and traceability of revocation.

## ðŸ”® Future Scope

- Integrate with front-end for easy use by institutions.
- Enable IPFS or Arweave to store actual certificate files.
- Add multi-signer or DAO-based revocation for decentralized governance.
- Use zk-SNARKs to verify certificates privately on-chain.
